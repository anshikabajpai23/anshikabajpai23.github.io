I'm Anshika Bajpai, where data science meets software engineering, and the possibilities are endless. With a foundation in Computer Science and Engineering from Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, I’ve navigated the worlds of software development and machine learning  from shaping large-scale systems as a Senior Software Engineer at Optum, to advancing AI research as a Machine Learning Scientist Intern at Taiyo LLC. Now pursuing my Master’s in Data Science at Indiana University Bloomington, I bring a forward-thinking approach to solving complex problems, recently contributing as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern at Palo Alto Networks and publishing research in leading venues. My mission: build systems that don’t just work  they inspire, adapt, and create lasting impact.
