I am a Software Engineer at Optum, UnitedHealth Group. I completed my Bachelor of Technology with honors in the field of Computer Science and Engineering, from Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, India.

Throughout my college journey, I cultivated a keen interest in data science and machine learning. Engaging in various projects, I honed my skills in both research and technical domains. One of my notable project delved into the realm of mental health, where I explored the complexities of Instagram user behavior to predict mental health patterns. This endeavor stemmed from a curiosity to comprehend the impact of social media on the well-being of young minds.

In my free time, I love taking pictures to capture special moments. I enjoy getting lost in books, and finding inspiration in their stories. Playing badminton keeps me active and having fun with friends. And when I want to be creative, I pick up a paintbrush and let my imagination flow on canvas. These hobbies bring a lot of joy and variety to my life.
